InputManager.framework
===============================================================================

A framework for managing input method/language or keyboard layouts on OS X.

It's a thin (and incomplete) wrapper around Text Input Source Services, and it
currently requires garbage collection to run.


Want to help?
-------------

Please help make InputManager.framework helpful to others, for example by
making it usable with a retain/release application or wrapping the rest of the
API.

Do whatever you want with it, it's nothing special, it's yours.

But I would appreciate if you sent me an e-mail (jens at nockert.se) and tell
me if you (dis)like it.
